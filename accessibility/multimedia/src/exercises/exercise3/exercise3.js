📚 Exercise 3: Videos and GIFs 📚

Welcome to Exercise 3: Videos!
This exercise is more open-ended than
the last ones, to model the nature
of videos and GIFs.

Videos and GIFs (we don't perscribe a
specific pronunciation) are some of the
most interesting kinds of multimedia to
provide alternative text for. It's not
as straightforward to provide a single
sentence as alt text for a long video
or GIF. How can you provide meaningful
alternatives to people who cannot
see or hear (in the case of videos)
the content?

* Videos: 
** Captions (either pre-supplied or real time)

* GIFs: 
** Alt text for short GIFs
   (less than 5 seconds)
** Text equivalent for long GIFs
   (more than 5 seconds)

* Videos and GIFs:
** Subtitles (provided in code or baked in)
** Transcriptions

In this exercise, we have a few videos and GIFs
with varying modes of presentation.
Ask yourself: "If I could not see/hear this media,
how would I be able to tell what's in it?"

🛠️ Your goal in this exercise is to present the 
🛠️ content of these different kinds of media in
🛠️ an accessible way. This is meant to be 
🛠️ more open-ended

💡 How will someone who can't see a GIF 
💡 know what's in it? How can someone with
💡 hearing problems know who is 
💡 saying what in a video? Or how can they know
💡 what's going on in a video?
💡 Use your A11y knowledge, and CodeSandbox hints,
💡 to address accessibility issues!

⭐ Extra Credit: How can we accessibly add a captions
⭐ menu to let watchers change the language
⭐ they see captions in? Implement a solution
⭐ that changes the caption track used in the video!
